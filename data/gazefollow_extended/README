This is an extended version of annotations that have been made (by Chong et al. ECCV 2018), based on the MIT GazeFollow dataset (Recasens et al. NIPS 2015).

It provides additional labels for whether the gaze target lies within image frame or outside the frame for each training image.
Test images are all considered inside cases.
Additionally, it also provides the head bounding box coordinates as they were not included in the original MIT GazeFollow annotations.
All the other fields (image, body, eyes, gaze, source info) are directly copied from the MIT GazeFollow data without alteration.


Train split
  Format:
  [image_path,id,body_bbox_x,body_bbox_y,body_bbox_width,body_bbox_height,eye_x,eye_y,gaze_x,gaze_y,head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max,in_or_out,meta]

  Description:
  <head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max,in_or_out> are the added fields to GazeFollow.
  Head bounding box <head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max> is in the image pixel coordinate.
  <in_or_out> is 1 for inside, 0 for outside cases. There are a few -1's to denote invalid case (e.g., no human at all, upper body is cut, etc).


Test split
  Format:
  [image_path,id,body_bbox_x,body_bbox_y,body_bbox_width,body_bbox_height,eye_x,eye_y,gaze_x,gaze_y,head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max,meta]

  Description:
  <head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max> are the added fields to GazeFollow.
  Head bounding box <head_bbox_x_min,head_bbox_y_min,head_bbox_x_max,head_bbox_y_max> is in the image pixel coordinate.

  Note:
  Each test image has been annotated multiple times by different people.
  There is no <in_or_out> field since all images are considered inside cases.
